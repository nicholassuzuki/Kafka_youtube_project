Things that needed to be installed
Docker
Docker-Compose (I believe to package all the different components i.e kafka, zookeeper, RDkafka)
kafka 
zookeeper -- needed to run cluseter even though we dont really use it

RDkafka (Node_module) -- The node-rdkafka library is a high-performance NodeJS client for Apache Kafka that wraps the native librdkafka library. 
All the complexity of balancing writes across partitions and managing (possibly ever-changing) brokers should be encapsulated in the library.

AVSC - Serialized and deserializes data (objects) that we put into the stream


In order to run the command "npm run start:producer" to view the produce, in the package.json file,
i had to add *"type": "module",* on line 11.  (not there before.)  This was the error...
SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module
